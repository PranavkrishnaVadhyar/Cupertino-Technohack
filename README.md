* Our product is a packaged UI component that can be added to HTML pages by calling a function that helps in performing MongoDB aggregation easily.

* It renders a aggregation pipeline created from the user and generates the aggregation code , making it easier for no programmers like data analysts from the  steep learning curve required to aggregate MongoDB data.
